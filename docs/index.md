## Why Vibecoding?

Traditional coding is often solitary and frustrating. Vibecoding transforms development into a conversational, iterative process where you collaborate with AI to:

- **Move faster** - Go from idea to implementation in less time
- **Learn continuously** - Understand patterns and best practices as you build
- **Reduce friction** - Focus on solving problems, not fighting syntax
- **Share knowledge** - Document and share what works for the community

## Get Involved

This is an open source project built by and for the community. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, your contributions are welcome!
